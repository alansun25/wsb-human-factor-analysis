# Analysis of human-influenced factors on post popularity in r/wallstreetbets
Project 1 - CSCI 377: Human Work in Computational Systems

In an ideal system, we would like for the crowdsourcing system of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) to promote those posts which are high quality, and demote those which are not. In other words, we would like to envision a system which differentiates quality posts from the rest. In practice, due to the inherently human nature of crowdsourcing, the success of a post deviates tremendously from just its qualityâ€”things such as emojis, vulgarity, length, time, and others all have specific appeal to human users and thus affect the success of a post.

In this project, we aim to quantify the magnitude these effects have on the overall success of the post. We hope to answer the following questions: Which human-influenced factors influence post popularity in the r/wallstreetbets subreddit? How do these popular posts influence future posts?

We use [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/reddit-rwallstreetbets).
